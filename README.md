### 🧑‍💻 Proof of Collaboration
The following PNG files serve as proof of teamwork between me and my teammate during our Google Meet project work sessions:

- `screenshot 3.jpg`
- `screenshot 4.jpg`

These screenshots were taken during our collaborative discussions and coding sessions to demonstrate our joint contribution and coordination throughout the project, as required by the instructor.
